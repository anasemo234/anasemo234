### Hi there 👋, What is up ✌🏾
I am working on a project right now using an API to get random quotes. Will also be working on other projects in the near future. I am currently a software engineer attending General Assembly's Software Engineer Remote program with some skills under my belt and many more to come!

* 💻 I'm spending some time learning JavaScript and React
* ⚽️ Away from my desk I am playing soccer or cooking 🍝.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a full-stack application using Node/Express/MongoDb!!
